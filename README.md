The `auth` package provides convenience functions for JWT auth as well as basic password authentication. It also provides API endpoint handlers for user login that are designed to be easily usable with the `github.com/flick-web/dispatch` package.

This package probably shouldn't be used for anything serious, as it's not production-ready.
